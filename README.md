Impulse charge-discharge device 20-30A for Arduino

The most relevant version is in Box directory. 
The current stabilization is achieved through pwm-ing the transistors circuits, making pulse-current mean level achieve the desired value.
Please use correct filters(C-L-C) to obtain constant current flow. 

Tested under 20A continuous, also tested under 30A.
